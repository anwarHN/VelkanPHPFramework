VelkanPHPFramework
==================

Velkan PHP framework is a simple PHP MVC framework. My intention is to offer something very simple, very easy to understand, and offcourse, free.  I'm from Honduras, so the documentation is in spanish. Feel free to download it.

You need Apache Server, PHP 4+, and MySql.

This framework has the hability to work with different databases, but by the moment, i only have the MySql adapter.
